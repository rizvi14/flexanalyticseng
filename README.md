# Flex Analytics Engineering Exercise

For context, I've never used or toyed with a piece of JavaScript before, nor have I really ever published publicly to Github. \
Consider this project an example of my resourcefulness, to get this data exercise done as best as possible all by myself.

**Step 1: Simplifying the deliverable (concept) from the raw script.** \
It seems like the JavaScript looks similar to a list of values in Python. Having seen JSON strings before, I know that they are used to concatenate a lot of data into a single cell/row so that multiple columns for additional data are not necessary. I can take the entire code block and organize it into its sections so that it can ***show me*** its structure and I can then use that to diagram the entities.

**Question 1, Action 1** \
So I pasted the JavaScript into VSCode and right-clicked "Format Document" to make it more readable. "Office Equipment" and "Computers and Accessories" seemed to have a line break that threw off the data structure, so I fixed those two lines and clicked Format Document again. That gave me a cleaner structure to read + chart. My chart can be found at [this file in the repsitory](https://github.com/rizvi14/flexanalyticseng/blob/main/flexanalyticseng.drawio)
